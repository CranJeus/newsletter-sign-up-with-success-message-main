## My process
a lot of my process was just hunting down bugs especially with the images and their behaviour. But like usual i break down the layout into its component pieces and see how they interact then group them accordingly. For this i decided to use hidden divs to handle the popup/popover.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

A lot of what i learned here was to spend a bit more time planning then implementing. I had to swap about halfway through to go mobile first instead of desktop first, this ended up causing many bugs in and around refactoring.

### Continued development

now that i have a bit more of a base in the standard CSS and JS i wanna implement them in the frameworks i am familiar with (MERN and MEAN stacks). I also want to branch out into .net with C# and see how that goes.
